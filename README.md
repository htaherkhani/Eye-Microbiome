# Machine learning & Eye-Microbiome
In the realm of computer science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a prominent field dedicated to crafting algorithms that emulate specific facets of human intelligence. In recent years, there has been a remarkable surge in the advancement of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology. This surge has subsequently prompted a widespread adoption of deep learning techniques across various applications. To gain insight into how AI can be harnessed for the detection of eye diseases, it becomes imperative that we possess a comprehensive understanding of AI's fundamental principles. This paper endeavors to elucidate the latest and most relevant applications of artificial intelligence within the diverse domains of ophthalmology, focusing on disease detection and diagnosis.

Explanation:

The original text discusses the role of AI in computer science, particularly its application in recognizing eye diseases within the field of ophthalmology.
The rewritten version retains the core ideas but presents them in a more concise and clear manner, emphasizing the significance of understanding AI's fundamental principles for its use in detecting eye diseases.
